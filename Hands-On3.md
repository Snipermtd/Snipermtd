# What I've learned ðŸ§ 
- I am already familiar with the basic Git workflow, so I didn't learn much in way of that, but I did learn about *styling* and the different things that can be done with Markdown files.
  - There are a **vast** amount of different ways to style and customize them and I look forward to becoming <ins>well-versed</ins> in GitHub markdown.
- I learned about the profile README. I wasn't aware they were thing, so that was interesting.
- I wasn't too familiar with Branches and Forks, so I read further and learned about those aspects of Git.
